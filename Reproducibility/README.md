This directory contains the information necessary to reproduce the results in the Pasa manuscript.

download_genome_ncbi-server.ipynb contains the information to download the reference genomes that were used in our benchmark. The availability of short-read assemblies can be found in the manuscript.

runPasaPipeline.py: Run the Pasa pipeline for real datasets.

scaffolding_workflow-PantaMemOpt-Kp-shovill.ipynb contains information about the experiments conducted on the simulated data.

scaffolding_workflow-PantaMemOpt-Kp-add-real-SPADES.ipynb contains the information when a related species is used. See the section titled "Scaffolding using the pangenome of a related species"

scaffolding_workflow-PantaMemOpt-Kquasi-shovill.ipynb: similar to scaffolding_workflow-PantaMemOpt-Kp-add-real-SPADES.ipynb, but it uses shovill instead of SPAdes.
